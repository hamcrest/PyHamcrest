=== Version 1.6 ==

27 Sep 2011
(All changes by Chris Rose unless otherwise noted.)

* Packaging:
 - Python 3.2 support.

* New matchers:
 - has_property('property_name', value_matcher) matches if object has a property with a given name whose value satisfies a given matcher.

* Improvements:
 - hasEntries supports two new calling conventions:
    has_entries({'key' : value_matcher, 'key_2' : other_value_matcher})
    has_entries(key=value_matcher, key_2=other_value_matcher)
 - Describe Unicode strings by their __repr__. Thanks to: Sebastian Arming
 - Rewrote documentation. (Jon Reid)


== Version 1.5 ==

29 Apr 2011
* Packaging:
 - Python 3.1 support. Thanks to: Chris Rose
 - Easier installation with bootstrapping. Thanks to: Chris Rose

* Mock integration:
 - "match_equality" wraps a matcher to define equality in terms of satisfying the matcher. This allows Hamcrest matchers to be used in libraries that are not Hamcrest-aware, such as Michael Foord's mock library. Thanks to: Chris Rose

* New matcher:
 - "string_contains_in_order" matches string containing given list of substrings, in order. Thanks to: Romilly Cocking

* Improved matchers:
 - For consistency, changed "any_of" and "all_of" to implicitly wrap non-matcher values in EqualTo. Thanks to: Chris Rose
 - Changed "sameInstance" mismatch description to omit address when describing
 None.


== Version 1.4 ==

13 Feb 2011
* New matchers:
 - "has_entries" matches dictionary containing key-value pairs satisfying a given list of alternating keys and value matchers.

* "assert_that" can be invoked with a single boolean argument; the reason message is now optional. This is a convenience replacement for assertTrue. Thanks to: Jeong-Min Lee

* Improved descriptions:
 - Reverted 1.3 change: Describe None as "<None>" after all, since it is an object.
 - "is_" no longer says "is ..." in its description, but just lets the inner description pass through.
 - Consistently use articles to begin descriptions, such as "a sequence containing" instead of "sequence containing".


== Version 1.3 ==

04 Feb 2011
* PyHamcrest is now compatible with Python 3! To install PyHamcrest on Python 3:
  - Install the "distribute" package, http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute
  - Run "python3 setup.py install"
  Unit tests are not converted by the install procedure. Run "2to3 -nw ." separately to convert them. You may discover import statements in the __init__.py files (and one in core/base_description.py) that need dot prefixes.
  Thanks to: Jeong-Min Lee

* Improved descriptions and mismatch descriptions of several matchers, including:
  - Fixed "contains" and "contains_inanyorder" to describe mismatch if item is not a sequence.
  - Fixed "described_as" to use nested matcher to generate mismatch description.
  - "same_instance" is more readable, and includes object memory addresses.
  - If object has a length, "has_length" mismatch describes actual length.
  - Describe None as "None" instead of "<None>".
  - Don't wrap angle brackets around a description that already has them.
  - Improved readability of several matchers.


== Version 1.2.1 ==

04 Jan 2011
* Fixed "assert_that" to describe the diagnosis of the mismatch, not just the
mismatched value. PyHamcrest will now give even more useful information.

* Expanded BaseDescription.append_description_of to handle all types of values, not just self-describing values.

* Deprecated:
 - Description.append_value no longer needed; call append_description_of instead.
 - BaseDescription.append_value_list no longer needed; call append_list instead.
 - SelfDescribingValue no longer needed.

1.2.1 fixes to 1.2:
- Corrected manifest so install works. Thanks to: Jeong-Min Lee


== Version 1.1 ==

28 Dec 2010
* New matchers:
  - "contains" matches sequence containing matching items in order.
  - "contains_inanyorder" matches sequence containing matching items in any order.

* Added Sphinx documentation support.


== Version 1.0 ==

04 Dec 2010
* First official release
* Text matchers now support Unicode strings

15 Jan 2008
* Initial submission
